          </div>
          <p>PRATHAM as it stands for Polymers, Rheology, Artificial Intelligence, Tissue Engineering, Hierarchical Materials, Advanced Materials and Modeling & Simulation is an attempt of bringing the intellectual contents from varied engineering disciplines. Chemical Engineers are known to be the experts of delivering optimal processes, whereas Mechanical Engineers can infuse the information related to mechanics. On one hand Biotechnology brings the essentials of 'Biological' details and on the other hand, Materials Engineering can go deep inside the matter and properties. The unique feature of this group is to amalgamate all these intelligence to answer the 'Biological Questions'. The truly multi-scale nature of the 'Bio-Challenges' can perhaps be best tackled when information flow can enrich the knowledge base across different length and time scales, i.e. from molecular to organ level, from instantaneous spikes to sustained outcomes.</p>
